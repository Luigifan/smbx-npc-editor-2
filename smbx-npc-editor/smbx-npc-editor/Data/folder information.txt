You can easily create an NPC editor with your own default configuration.

As an example, I include the SMBX64 (default SMBX) configuration. Inside of this contains some important files

|-npc
|-sprites
|-lvl_npc.ini
|-npc-config.ini

npc (folder)
The NPC folder from your SMBX installation! Yes, you can just copy and paste this into your configuration's directory

sprites (folder)
The 32x32 preview sprites used for the new file dialog. These are generated by a program in the tools folder.

lvl_npc.ini (ini file)
The INI file used to load default values, in Wohlstand's format.

I've also included tools to help you make your own configuration. Included is an INI Editor I made to help you edit Wohlstand's ini format a little easier and a tool to generate the scaled 32x32 sprite files.
